# Invoicer Codebase Analysis Plan

## Objective

Perform comprehensive analysis to identify mocked, stubbed, bypassed, or incomplete features in the Invoicer Flutter application.

## Analysis Strategy

### Phase 1: File Structure & Context Assessment

- Map all Dart files in lib/ directory
- Identify key modules and dependencies
- Understand data flow and architecture patterns

### Phase 2: Deep Code Analysis (Multi-Agent Approach)

#### Agent 1: State Management Analysis

**Target**: `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/state.dart`
**Focus**:

- Identify state-only updates that don't persist
- Find methods that modify signals without external sync
- Look for stub implementations in folder/file management
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments
- Verify persistence layer completeness

#### Agent 2: PDF Processing & AI Extraction Analysis

**Target**: `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/extractor.dart`
**Focus**:

- Check PDF text extraction completeness
- Verify AI API integration (error handling, retries)
- Identify placeholder returns or mocked data
- Check for incomplete error handling
- Verify caching implementation

#### Agent 3: Data Models Analysis

**Target**: `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/models.dart`
**Focus**:

- Check serialization/deserialization completeness
- Identify missing validation
- Look for stub methods or incomplete implementations
- Verify field completeness vs schema

#### Agent 4: Folders View Analysis

**Target**: `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/views/folders_view.dart`
**Focus**:

- Identify UI-only operations (e.g., rename without file system sync)
- Check folder management operations (add, remove, rename)
- Verify file system synchronization
- Look for incomplete CRUD operations

#### Agent 5: Files View Analysis

**Target**: `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/views/files_view.dart`
**Focus**:

- Check file operations completeness
- Identify state-only updates vs persistent changes
- Verify batch processing implementation
- Look for incomplete filtering/sorting features

#### Agent 6: Settings & Dialogs Analysis

**Targets**:

- `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/dialogs/settings_dialog.dart`
- `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/dialogs/file_detail_dialog.dart`
  **Focus**:
- Verify settings persistence
- Check for incomplete configuration options
- Identify placeholder UI elements
- Verify data editing completeness

#### Agent 7: Main App & Utils Analysis

**Targets**:

- `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/main.dart`
- `/Users/helge/code/invoicer/lib/utils.dart`
  **Focus**:
- Check initialization completeness
- Verify utility function implementations
- Look for startup configuration gaps
- Identify incomplete error handling

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition

- Cross-reference findings to identify systemic issues
- Categorize issues by type (mocked, bypassed, incomplete)
- Assess impact and priority
- Identify common patterns of incompleteness

### Phase 4: Documentation Synthesis

- Create comprehensive findings report
- Organize by category and priority
- Include code snippets and line numbers
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Create summary dashboard

## Search Strategy for Common Patterns

Will search for these indicators across all files:

- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` comments
- `print()` statements (may indicate debugging code)
- Empty method bodies or `return;` statements
- Placeholder data (`test`, `example`, `dummy`, `mock`)
- Methods that don't call filesystem operations
- State updates without corresponding persistence
- Exception handling with empty catch blocks
- Commented-out code sections

## Token Budget Management

- Use targeted grep searches before full file reads
- Read files incrementally (by section if large)
- Create summary documents per agent
- Consolidate findings progressively
- Monitor token usage continuously

## Expected Deliverables

1. **PLAN.md** - This file (analysis strategy)
2. **FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary of all issues
3. **MOCKED_FEATURES.md** - Catalog of mocked/stubbed features
4. **BYPASSED_OPERATIONS.md** - Operations that don't persist
5. **INCOMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md** - TODOs and gaps
6. **PRIORITY_MATRIX.md** - Categorized by impact and urgency
7. **RECOMMENDATIONS.md** - Actionable next steps

## Success Criteria

- All 9 Dart files thoroughly analyzed
- Each finding includes file path, line number, and description
- Clear categorization of issue types
- Priority assessment for each finding
- Comprehensive recommendations for completion
